Meanwhile, rainfall records were broken in parts of Victoria and Tasmania this week, leaving many tourism operators reeling.</p> <p>Terry Cole, a mountain biking operator in northern Tasmania, says his business has been heavily affected by the flooding on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big hit to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be shut down for a couple of days because of the rain and it\u2019s the first time in a while the trails have had to close.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mainly the creeks crossing the trails that have swelled, making it dangerous to go down.

The impact of the weather has been sustained and protracted.\u201d</p> <p>Harley says in 2019, before the pandemic and bushfires, Emu Trekkers were running five hikes a week on average.

     "body": "<p>The two parts of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire are discussing a merger nearly a decade after they split.</p> <p>The merger would combine Murdoch\u2019s Fox News and TMZ assets with News Corp\u2019s newspaper and online news operations, including the Times and the Sun in the UK, the Wall Street Journal and New York Post in the US, and the Australian.</p> <p>In a press release, News Corp confirmed that following instructions from Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust, the companies have formed a special committee \u201ccomposed of independent and disinterested members of the board\u201d to begin exploring a potential combination.</p> <p>The Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the News Corp chief executive, Robert Thomson, had informed staff about the potential merger.</p> <p>\u201cAt News Corp, we are constantly pursuing ways to enhance our performance and expand our businesses, and the upheaval in media presents both challenges and opportunities,\u201d he wrote in a memo. \u201cHowever, I would like to stress that the Special Committee has not made any determination at this time, and there can be no certainty that any transaction will result from its evaluation.\u201d</p> <p>After years of expansion globally, Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/11/news-corp-shareholders-breakup-rupert-murdoch\">split his empire in 2013</a>, placing the print business in a newly created public entity, News Corp, and the TV and entertainment under 21st Century Fox.</p> <p>Murdoch said at the time that his vast media holdings had become \u201cincreasingly complex\u201d and that a new structure would simplify operations. The split also shielded Fox\u2019s entertainment assets from any potential financial fallout from a phone hacking scandal involving the media conglomerate\u2019s now-defunct News of the World publication in the UK.</p> <p>The thinking at the time was that separating the companies ultimately would generate value for shareholders, according to one person familiar with the decision-making. That vision was realized as Fox sold the bulk of its film and television assets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix\">to Walt Disney for $71bn</a> in 2019.</p> <p>The sale left Fox focused on live events such as news and sports, rather than \u201cdisruptable\u201d scripted entertainment content on the streaming platforms, Wall Street analysts observed at the time.</p> <p>The major streaming services, however, have begun breaching the protective moat. Apple and Amazon, two technology giants with deep financial resources, have begun bidding for sports, securing rights to stream Major League Baseball, soccer and football games.</p> <p>Fox recently renewed a long-term deal with the NFL to continue broadcasting Sunday afternoon games, but relinquished Thursday Night Football to Amazon.</p> <p>Reuniting Fox and News Corp would give the combined companies greater scale to compete, and complement their assets, the person familiar with the proposal said. The combined companies would have about $24bn in revenue.</p> <p>Murdoch, 91, currently has near-controlling stakes in both the companies. His son Lachlan Murdoch is chairman and CEO of Fox Corp. Companies that adopt such arrangements typically make subsequent mergers subject to approval by a majority of shareholders not affiliated with their controlling shareholder, though it\u2019s not clear whether this will be the case in this instance.</p> <p>As of market-close on Friday, News Corp had a market cap of $9.31bn and Fox Corp was $16.84bn. News Corp shares surged 5% and Fox rose about 1% in after-market trade.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this story</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>On arrival at Perth airport last week, wicketkeeper Matthew Wade said that his team\u2019s heavy loss to England in last year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup group stage was \u201cthe lightbulb moment\u201d that made the Australians change the way they approached the format and go on to win that tournament.</p> <p>A week after Wade spoke in Perth, having endured three more beltings by England in the interim, it is reasonable to wonder whether the lightbulb is flickering.</p> <p>Only rain in the final match could turn whitewash to washout. The first two matches took different routes to identical margins of eight runs, once when England\u2019s batting blitzed a score of over 200, then when the cleverness of England\u2019s bowling defended a more modest score.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/14/cricket-t20-world-cup-australia-intrigue-upsets\">Intrigue and upsets on the menu as T20 World Cup begins in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the third match it was adaptability that had England on top, the batters walking back after two rain delays to loot 39 runs from the final 14 balls of a shortened innings.</p> <p>Josh Hazlewood is Australia\u2019s standard-bearer for Test bowling, the tall quick with the accuracy to hitting a coin on the pitch, and who has more recently adapted his game to suit 20-over cricket. Jos Buttler is England\u2019s captain, and currently the shortest format\u2019s most consistently destructive batter in the world.</p> <p>It felt symbolic to see Buttler calmly eviscerating a Hazlewood over, picking slower ball from full pace with a yawn in his throat, placing the fuller balls through the off side and the marginally shorter ones over leg to collect 22 runs from six shots.</p> <p>Then there was England\u2019s swing bowler Chris Woakes, a man whose glum Ashes visits have seen him take a wicket in Australia every 95 balls, starting up on this damp Canberra evening to find movement and create catches from the first two deliveries of the match.</p> <p>The DLS score adjustment had set Australia 130 to win, meaning that the required run rate soon exceeded 12 per over. The home team was gone, even before more rain. None of which is to say that Australia got much wrong. They go into the upcoming World Cup with an excellent best XI and an adaptable squad. It\u2019s just that right now, England look a better side on paper and on grass.</p> <p>The same was true at last year\u2019s tournament, when they were stacked with batting power top to tail while Australia had frailties exposed. The path to that trophy didn\u2019t rely on finding a way to beat England, it relied on avoiding them. New Zealand offered a trans-Tasman favour by maintaining the historical role of New Zealand cricket: being a giant-killer against everybody else before falling apart against Australia.</p> <p>So the old rivalry is set at an interesting point with this year\u2019s tournament about to start. All three of the aforementioned teams are in the same group, with Afghanistan and two qualifiers that will most likely be Sri Lanka along with Ireland or Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Don\u2019t discount the Sri Lankans, who recorded some stirring wins across all three formats against Australia in June and July before storming on to win the Asia Cup. But as usual most eyes will be on Australia versus England, first in the group stage and then possibly again in the knockouts.</p> <p>By then, memories of warm-up matches will be distant. Everything starts fresh in a big tournament as you wait for the umpire to call play. But there are still aspects of significance that could carry over. England\u2019s batters have shown no fear of the blue-chip pace trio of Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood. Buttler regards all bowling as there to be scored from, and his players follow his lead.</p> <p>England\u2019s bowlers fancy themselves against Australia\u2019s top order, and can find ways to suppress explosions from the middle. And on a longer timeline, Australian teams find ways to win the big moments even when by rights they should not.</p> <p>The dynamics between certain teams within a tournament context can be fascinating. Take Pakistan losing to India at World Cups for decades, and the eruption of delight when they finally broke that streak last October. The objective quality of sides outside tournaments is not always reflected in certain match-ups within them.</p> <p>England\u2019s era of white-ball excellence from 2015 to now has not landed the biggest T20 prize, and last year\u2019s World Cup did nothing to settle whether it made them a better side than Australia: if a World Cup match makes the warm-up fade to nothing, a final makes the group stage do the same.</p> <p>In 2022, after a long wait, a knockout meeting would be a satisfying path to closure.</p>"

He said the moderator misstated his position. That contradicted statements made repeatedly on the campaign trail, including in July when Walker said it was \u201ca problem\u201d that no national ban existed.</p> \n<p>Walker also answered an attack from Warnock about his past claims about being a law enforcement officer by producing what he said was a police badge.</p> \n<p>Warnock said: \u201cYou can support police officers as I\u2019ve done \u2026 while at the same time holding police officers, like all professions, accountable. One thing I have not done, I\u2019ve never pretended to be a police officer. And I\u2019ve never, I\u2019ve never threatened a shootout with the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saying \u201cI have to respond to that\u201d, Walker produced his badge.</p> \n<p>Walker has never been a trained law enforcement officer, though he has law enforcement endorsements.</p> \n<p>As Walker brandished his badge, the debate moderator said: \u201cMr Walker, Mr Walker \u2013 excuse me, Mr Walker. I need to let you know, Mr Walker, you are very well aware of the rules tonight. And you have a prop that is not allowed. Sir, I asked you to put that prop away.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walker did not do so immediately.</p> \n<p>The moderator said: \u201cExcuse me, sir. You\u2019re very well aware of the rules, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> \n<p>Walker said: \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about the truth.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walker\u2019s apparent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times\">battle with the truth over abortion</a> has become a theme of the midterm elections. On Friday, he said his position was the same as Georgia\u2019s state law, a so-called heartbeat bill that bans abortion at six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. That law went into effect this year after the US supreme court overturned the right to abortion.</p> \n<p>The heated exchange on abortion was one of many that highlighted stark differences between Warnock and Walker. Warnock did not directly bring up the allegation about Walker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times\">paying for an abortion</a>, leaving moderators to elicit a flat denial. Walker blasted Warnock for being a Baptist pastor who supports abortion rights.</p> \n<p>\u201cInstead of aborting those babies, why aren\u2019t you baptizing those babies?\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Warnock said \u201cGod gave us a choice and I respect the right of women to make a decision\u201d, adding that Walker \u201cwants to arrogate more power to politicians than God has\u201d.</p> \n<p>Warnock and his fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff won their Senate seats in a January 2021 special election, two months after Joe Biden beat Trump in Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes. It was the first time in two decades Democrats won federal elections in the state, raising questions about whether Warnock can win again as Biden\u2019s popularity falls.</p> \n<p>In-person voting begins on Monday. The outcome will help determine control of the Senate, currently split 50-50.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/herschel-walker-republicans-abortion-denial\">Republicans throw support behind Herschel Walker after abortion denial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Onstage, Walker claimed Warnock was a Biden puppet, saying the election was about what they \u201chad done to you and your family\u201d in an inflationary economy. Warnock said the election was about \u201cwho is ready to represent Georgia\u201d.</p> \n<p>Walker blamed Warnock and Biden for inflation but offered little when asked what he would do to fix it. Walker said the first step was \u201cgetting back\u201d to energy independence rather than depending \u201con our enemies\u201d. The US had never been free from fossil fuel imports, some from countries such as Russia.</p> \n<p>Warnock highlighted Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on provisions he sponsored capping insulin and other healthcare costs, the extension of the child tax credit and infrastructure provisions he shepherded with Republicans. He offered few specifics about further steps.</p> \n<p>Warnock declined to say if Biden, nearing 80, should seek re-election in 2024. Walker deviated from Trump by saying Biden won legitimately in 2020. But he said he would support Trump if he ran in 2024. Both Walker and Warnock said they would accept the outcome of their election.</p> \n<p>Both men discussed their personal lives. Recent reporting by the Daily Beast disclosed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times\">records of an abortion receipt and personal check</a> from Walker to a woman who said he paid for her abortion. Walker\u2019s denials have continued even after the woman identified herself as the mother of one of his four children. Walker acknowledged three children publicly for the first time only after Beast reporting.</p> \n<p>Other reports have detailed how Walker has exaggerated academic achievements, business success and philanthropic activities, as well as accusations he threatened the life of his ex-wife beyond details acknowledged in a 2008 memoir. In perhaps his most effective debate move, Warnock alluded to such stories.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will see time and time again tonight, as we\u2019ve always seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth,\u201d said Warnock.</p> \n<p>Dismissing reports that a foundation tied to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he is senior pastor, had evicted tenants from real-estate holdings, Warnock said Walker was trying to \u201csully the name of Martin Luther King\u2019s church\u201d.</p> \n<p>Walker pointed to his memoir, in which he detailed a diagnosis of dissociative personality disorder. Walker said he had \u201cbeen transparent\u201d and \u201ccontinue[d] to get help if I need help, but I don\u2019t need any help. I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m ready to lead today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walker declined three debates typical in Georgia campaigns. The Savannah debate did not include the libertarian Chase Oliver, who did not meet a polling threshold. Warnock will meet Oliver in a Sunday debate sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. Walker will be represented by an empty podium.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Picking through a pile of twisted metal, Rebaz, a Kurdish Iranian fighter, stooped to cradle a jagged chrome piece that was dug from the ruins of his base. \u201cThis was part of a Fateh missile,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest that the Iranians have in their arsenal. It\u2019s from the day they tried to wipe us out.\u201d</p> <p>The heap included other wreckage \u2013 of rockets and kamikaze drones that had devastated this small outpost, just east of Erbil in northern Iraq, a fortnight ago. Since then, jittery guards had looked from the ruins towards the east, from where more than two dozen ballistic missiles and another dozen kamikaze drones blazed from a blue sky a fortnight ago.</p> <p>The attack marked one of the biggest barrages of ballistic missiles anywhere in the region in at least the past decade and, across northern Iraq, few saw it coming. Except for the Iranian Kurds who have guarded this hilltop through war and insurrection, and knew what to expect from Iran, a mortal foe under mounting pressure at home.</p> <p>With the attacks, Iran sought to lay the blame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/oct/13/iran-women-sepideh-rashno-mahsa-amini-nika-shakarami-mass-protests\">for protests at home</a> on a long-term enemy, the fighters for an independent Kurdistan, a state the Kurdish ethnic group hope to one day establish on land currently in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.</p> <p>The missile barrages, three in total, sent close to 70 long-range warheads to Iranian Kurdish bases in northern Iraq, killing 14 fighters, wounding 58 and levelling bases that had fought Islamic State, the Iraqi army and Shia militias over the last eight years.</p> <p>They came as popular demonstrations were gathering momentum in Iran, pitting the country\u2019s women and youth against one of the region\u2019s most formidable police states. Two weeks later, and nearly six weeks into protests that continue to rattle Iran\u2019s theocratic leaders, the mood on the streets remains febrile.</p> <p>Faced with an impetus the regime did not expect, or know how to contain, officials have attempted to divert the conflict from the streets of towns, cities and even villages, to age-old geographic flashpoints and to the more modern battleground of the information space. On both counts Iranian attempts are flailing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a92db316248b91883a0c1741c030912a360d18e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a92db316248b91883a0c1741c030912a360d18e7/0_475_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The twisted remains of Iranian missiles and drones fired at the Kurdish Iranian base in northern Iraq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The twisted remains of Iranian missiles and drones fired at the Kurdish Iranian base in northern Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nechirvan Mando</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey are not winning on the ground, and they are not deceiving anyone in Iran, or outside,\u201d said Gen Hussein Yazdanpanah, the leader of an Iranian Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Freedom party (PAK). \u201cIran wants to demonstrate to the world that the protests are not relevant to what is happening inside the country and are instead driven by affairs from the outside. They are exporting this. They want the world\u2019s attention to be taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Yazdanpanah had come to know every inch of the hilltop that he had called a base over the past eight years. From down the road towards Kirkuk and over the hills nearby, IS had once hovered. When they were gone, Shia militias and the Iraqi army had tried to advance after an ill-fated Kurdish referendum five years ago.</p> <p>At all times, the Iranian Kurds stood their ground, committed to a broader Kurdish project as much as they were keeping Iran at bay. The general rejects Iranian claims that the protests are being driven by a Kurdish nationalist push. \u201cIt didn\u2019t start that way, and it isn\u2019t like that now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are tied to our people and the protesters. But it is not us that started these events. It is not our forces that are on the streets.</p> <p> \u201cBut they have to know that we will not stay silent in the face of this and we will defend our daughters\u2019 blood.\u201d</p> <p>The smell of death rose from the rubble; two fighters remained unaccounted for and only heavy equipment could shift the enormous piles of ruins caused by the ballistic missiles. What remained of the PAK\u2019s scorched arsenal lay baking in the autumn sun. But even among the devastation, work had started on a new base a mile away. \u201cWe will prevail,\u201d said Yazdanpanah. \u201cBut we are not satisfied with the way the international community has responded.\u201d</p> <p>As well as watching events unfold in Iran, Iranian Kurds are well versed in the war in Ukraine, where a steady supply of powerful weapons have helped fight back a Russian invasion and could help turn the course of the war. Kurdish forces in Iraq received weapons while the war against IS was raging. But that was nearly five years ago and, once again, the Kurds feel history, and their friends, have forgotten them.</p> <p>\u201cThis territory is supervised by the international coalition and they know our role in fighting Isis. How can an airspace be monitored by them and something like this be allowed to happen? It\u2019s like tying our hands and letting the wolf come for us. We are a people that has regularly been slaughtered for the price of supporting democracy and human rights. The only place in the region that allows room for democracy to be fertilised is here.\u201d</p> <p>He implored the international community to consider reimposing a no-fly zone, more than 20 years after another such zone was lifted. The first was to deter Saddam Hussein from attacking the Kurdish north. \u201cThe solution is to close our skies and to stop Iran targeting us. Iran does not respect diplomatic relations, nor soft power. It only knows strength.</p> <p>\u201cThe weapons that are being given to Ukraine could also be given to us. Even a small amount. You can give the Kurds in Iran similar support. Why are you not supporting a stateless people who have fought Isis and supported your interests? Without us, they would have made it to Europe.\u201d</p> <p>In nearby Erbil, which has so far been spared the Iranian barrage, but where officials are also considering calling for a new no-fly zone, an Iranian Kurdish refugee, Ibrahim, 29, from Urmia in the country\u2019s north-west, said he was hopeful the uprising would continue to gain momentum.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when protests in Iran happened every 10 years or so, but that gap has been closing. It\u2019s now every two years, and that shows that the regime is losing its hold.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t think they can continue to run a repressive regime like this in an information age. The worst thing for them was the Covid lockdown. People and students had all that time to stay at home and look at the internet. They saw how life could be and they wanted a taste of it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not an armed uprising for now. And I hope it doesn\u2019t become one. But if it does, the problem will be, where would those weapons come from. This needs to be taken very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>An Iranian Kurdish woman, Arina, 28, from Sanandaj, said: \u201cIt\u2019s never been like this, all minorities and ethnicities fighting together for basic human rights. I have many friends in the streets whom I talk to daily.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I talk to my friends I say they\u2019re very motivated. It\u2019s very different from previous protests. In some areas the government has already lost control.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Nechirvan Mando</em></p>"

They sold this month at a New Mexico auction for $76,000, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeans-vintage-levis-1880s-auction-buyer-11665444076\">Wall Street Journal</a> reported \u2013 among the highest prices jeans have ever fetched. The buyers, who each sell vintage clothing, were able to identify the jeans\u2019 age thanks to a number of clues: a missing logo stamp, suspender buttons and a single pocket on the seat, among other indicators.</p> <p>Another mark of the jeans\u2019 age: a label inside says they are \u201cthe only kind made by white labor\u201d.</p> <p>That message appeared after Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, amid widespread anti-Chinese racism, particularly as the <a href=\"https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/chineseinca/antichinese.html\">economy struggled in the 1870s</a>. Such bigotry was particularly prevalent in the west. San Francisco \u2013 home to Levi\u2019s, founded in 1853 \u2013 drew a large number of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, and, as Michael Luo wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-forgotten-history-of-the-purging-of-chinese-from-america\">New Yorker</a> last year, \u201cwhite workers \u2026 began to see the Chinese as competition \u2013 first for gold and, later, for scarce jobs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/experience-i-mine-for-denim\">Experience: I mine for 100-year-old jeans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exclusion law, which established a 10-year ban on Chinese laborers seeking to immigrate to the US, became the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act\">first major restriction on immigration</a> in the US. It <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Exclusion-Act\">was not repealed until 1943</a>.</p> <p>In the 1880s, \u201c\u200b\u200bthere was significant social pressure not to hire Chinese workers and [Levi Strauss and Co] adopted an anti-Chinese labor policy,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cLevi\u2019s also used advertisements and printing on our products to declare that our products were \u2018made by white labor\u2019, thinking it would improve sales and align with the views of consumers at the time.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1890s, the company said, \u201cwe reversed our policy and company leaders began speaking out against the nation\u2019s racist policy.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the design elements, the jeans\u2019 age is also clear from the wax spattered across them. Levi\u2019s were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/experience-i-mine-for-denim\">worn by silver miners</a> in the west, as Harris wrote in the Guardian in 2015, and miners lit their way with candles, the Journal notes.</p> <p>All this explains why Harris found them in a western mineshaft. \u201cWhen a miner got a new pair of work pants, he\u2019d cut up the old ones and use them for lagging around pipes, so there were a lot of antique jeans buried out here,\u201d he wrote in the 2015 piece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"026c103abb087305859da7365042718247bf7370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/026c103abb087305859da7365042718247bf7370/0_0_1490_1687/883.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of Levi\u2019s jeans from the 1880s.

The material can sell for hefty sums, but \u201cI\u2019m not focused on the money,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve become a sort of archivist and historian.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their historical significance, you might not know that the jeans were nearly 150 years old if you encountered them in a thrift shop. They\u2019re still fully wearable, according to Zip Stevenson, who paid 10% of the cost; the other 90% was covered by Kyle Haupert, a 23-year-old from San Diego, the Journal reported. The wearability \u201cis a big part of why we believe they are so extremely valuable,\u201d even if \u201cthey could use a little mending in a couple of spots\u201d, Stevenson wrote to the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>Stevenson, who runs Denim Doctors, a Los Angeles business that repairs well-loved clothing, became interested in the material when he worked at a shop selling vintage Levi\u2019s and realized they were selling for more than the brand-new pairs at a store a few doors down. He thinks the 1880s pair is worth \u201cno less than $150,000 and potentially quite a bit more\u201d, he says. \u201cWe believe that there\u2019s no reason they would not be worth even up to $1m in the context of other collectible things like rare watches, art by famous artists, rare comic books and sports memorabilia.\u201d</p> <p>And who might have the money to make such an investment? \u201cI could see a wealthy eccentric person buying them and then wearing them from time to time like people that wear million-dollar Paul Newman Rolex watches,\u201d Stevenson said.</p> <p>But the ideal buyer would be \u201csomeone that will then offer them on permanent loan to a highly visited museum like a Smithsonian or the Metropolitan Museum in New York so that people could see them in perpetuity\u201d as a part of American history, Stevenson added. \u201cWe are OK to be patient to find the right home for them.\u201d</p>"
