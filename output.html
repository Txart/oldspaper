<h1>‘A big hit to us’: how La Niña is driving Australia’s tour operators to the brink</h1><h3> Publication date: 2022-10-15</h3><br><p>Like many tourism operators on Australia’s east coast, Laura Stone has gotten used to watching and reading the weather.</p> <p>Stone operates Sydney By Kayak and says her business has been deeply impacted by the ongoing heavy rain.</p> <p>“I would say, without a doubt, that La Niña and the weather we’ve experienced over the last couple of years has affected our business more than the pandemic,” she says.</p> <p>“We’re probably losing about 50% of bookings because of the rain. I’ve actually had to hire more staff to man the office, to deal with the amount of reschedules and questions on the weather.”</p> <p>Stone says La Niña events combined with the Covid-19 pandemic and the early 2019 bushfires have sapped her morale.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/09/could-a-fourth-la-nina-follow-sydneys-record-breaking-rainfall">Could a fourth La Niña follow Sydney’s record-breaking rainfall?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“They have changed my life,” she says. “Towards the end of last season, I was exhausted from every day checking the weather in the morning. I’d wake up and look out the window and wonder what the weather was doing. It drove me a little insane.”</p> <p>Eastern Australia is bracing for another wet summer after the Bureau of Meteorology declared a third La Niña in a row last month. Meanwhile, rainfall records were broken in parts of Victoria and Tasmania this week, leaving many tourism operators reeling.</p> <p>Terry Cole, a mountain biking operator in northern Tasmania, says his business has been heavily affected by the flooding on Friday.</p> <p>“It’s a big hit to us,” he says. “We’re going to be shut down for a couple of days because of the rain and it’s the first time in a while the trails have had to close.</p> <p>“It’s mainly the creeks crossing the trails that have swelled, making it dangerous to go down. But it means we’ve had to refund all the existing bookings over the next couple of days.”</p> <p>Cole says his business, MTB Express, usually closes during the winter, making shutdowns due to rain particularly painful.</p> <p>“We were finally cranking again after two years of Covid and we had a bit of money in the bank, some people employed, but we’ve had to stop and refund people.

<p>The Australian government reinstated the full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/reinstating-the-fuel-excise-how-much-will-petrol-prices-rise-and-why-now">fuel excise</a> tax in September after the Morrison Coalition government introduced a temporary, six-month cut to lower the cost of fuel at a time of rising inflation.</p> 
<p>Since it was reintroduced, 24c has been added to the cost of fuel by the litre, but petrol prices have largely remained stable and not yet returned to the more than $2 highs in May. However, a recent decision by the Opec+ oil cartel to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/05/fears-grow-over-oil-price-as-opec-agrees-to-cut-output">slash output</a> has analysts predicting prices will increase.</p> 
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been a key factor in driving up the price of oil, which climbed to US$130 a barrel earlier this year, but has since fallen back to under $100 a barrel.</p> 
<p>High oil prices have exacerbated the cost of living crisis and inflation globally.</p>

    <p>Founded in 1960, the cartel of the world’s biggest oil producers emerged as a political and economic force with the 1973-74 US oil embargo, which caused oil prices to spike. The club consists of 13 countries, with Saudi Arabia the biggest producer, followed by Iraq and Iran.<br></p>
    <p>In response to the 2014-16 oil price slump, Opec partnered with Russia in December 2016 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/oil-price-surges-opec-non-opec-agree-deal-cut-output">to agree a cut in production of 1.8m barrels a day</a>. That curb, the first of its kind in 15 years, drove up the price of oil. In May 2017, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/25/opec-meeting-oil-price-saudi-arabia-production">the cuts were extended until the end of March 2018</a>. <br><br><a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/">Opec</a>'s official members are: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Indonesia and Qatar's membership has lapsed.</p>
    <p>The Opec+ group, sometimes known as "Vienna Group", adds 10 non-member nations, including Kazakhstan, Mexico and Russia. Between them these nations supply 55% of oil production and hold 90% of the planet's oil reserves.</p>

<p>According to the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the price of petrol for the week ending 9 October averaged 182.5c a litre nationally. The highest average was in Adelaide at 186.9c a litre, with the lowest in Darwin at 173.6 cents a litre. Prices averaged 183.2c a litre in Sydney and 182.9c a litre in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Dr Ian Jeffries from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland said the price of petrol in most capital cities follows a month-long cycle and is currently in a “cheap phase” that will begin to lift over the next few weeks.</p> 
<p>“That’s when we’ll start to see the effect of the fuel excise increase,” Jeffries said. “In Brisbane we’d expect prices to jump to $2.10 and that includes the return of the fuel excise.”</p>

<p>Jeffries said it was difficult to predict what exactly was going to happen to the price of fuel over the medium to long term as there were “several factors pulling and pushing” on the global oil market that created significant uncertainty.</p> 
<p>Governments around the world, primarily the US, are currently releasing stocks from strategic oil reserves in an attempt to push down prices and tame inflation, but Opec cuts will work against that.</p> 
<p>Joaquin Vespignani, an associate professor of the Tasmanian School of Business and Economics, said Opec was “trying to squeeze the market for its last big profit”.</p>

</aside> 
<p>“They know the market is moving away from oil and that’s why they’re going to cut production to keep prices high for as long as they can, basically,” Vespignani said.</p> 
<p>“There is a tension between short-term gains and long-term pain. They want to squeeze for more profits, but if the price is high the transition to renewables will be faster.”</p> 
<p>He added there was “common agreement” among economists that cutting the fuel excise was “a very bad policy” as it temporarily created a false perception and blunted the growing demand for alternatives such as electric vehicles.</p> 
<p>It is expected this demand will grow as prices rise, though Vespignani said Australia was being held back by a lack of policy and planning to help facilitate the transition.</p>

The split also shielded Fox’s entertainment assets from any potential financial fallout from a phone hacking scandal involving the media conglomerate’s now-defunct News of the World publication in the UK.</p> <p>The thinking at the time was that separating the companies ultimately would generate value for shareholders, according to one person familiar with the decision-making. That vision was realized as Fox sold the bulk of its film and television assets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix">to Walt Disney for $71bn</a> in 2019.</p> <p>The sale left Fox focused on live events such as news and sports, rather than “disruptable” scripted entertainment content on the streaming platforms, Wall Street analysts observed at the time.</p> <p>The major streaming services, however, have begun breaching the protective moat. Apple and Amazon, two technology giants with deep financial resources, have begun bidding for sports, securing rights to stream Major League Baseball, soccer and football games.</p> <p>Fox recently renewed a long-term deal with the NFL to continue broadcasting Sunday afternoon games, but relinquished Thursday Night Football to Amazon.</p> <p>Reuniting Fox and News Corp would give the combined companies greater scale to compete, and complement their assets, the person familiar with the proposal said. The combined companies would have about $24bn in revenue.</p> <p>Murdoch, 91, currently has near-controlling stakes in both the companies. His son Lachlan Murdoch is chairman and CEO of Fox Corp. Companies that adopt such arrangements typically make subsequent mergers subject to approval by a majority of shareholders not affiliated with their controlling shareholder, though it’s not clear whether this will be the case in this instance.</p> <p>As of market-close on Friday, News Corp had a market cap of $9.31bn and Fox Corp was $16.84bn. News Corp shares surged 5% and Fox rose about 1% in after-market trade.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this story</em></p><h1>Old rivals Australia and England circle Twenty20 World Cup seeking knockout punch</h1><h3> Publication date: 2022-10-15</h3><br><p>On arrival at Perth airport last week, wicketkeeper Matthew Wade said that his team’s heavy loss to England in last year’s Twenty20 World Cup group stage was “the lightbulb moment” that made the Australians change the way they approached the format and go on to win that tournament.</p> <p>A week after Wade spoke in Perth, having endured three more beltings by England in the interim, it is reasonable to wonder whether the lightbulb is flickering.</p> <p>Only rain in the final match could turn whitewash to washout. The first two matches took different routes to identical margins of eight runs, once when England’s batting blitzed a score of over 200, then when the cleverness of England’s bowling defended a more modest score.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/14/cricket-t20-world-cup-australia-intrigue-upsets">Intrigue and upsets on the menu as T20 World Cup begins in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the third match it was adaptability that had England on top, the batters walking back after two rain delays to loot 39 runs from the final 14 balls of a shortened innings.</p> <p>Josh Hazlewood is Australia’s standard-bearer for Test bowling, the tall quick with the accuracy to hitting a coin on the pitch, and who has more recently adapted his game to suit 20-over cricket. Jos Buttler is England’s captain, and currently the shortest format’s most consistently destructive batter in the world.</p> <p>It felt symbolic to see Buttler calmly eviscerating a Hazlewood over, picking slower ball from full pace with a yawn in his throat, placing the fuller balls through the off side and the marginally shorter ones over leg to collect 22 runs from six shots.</p> <p>Then there was England’s swing bowler Chris Woakes, a man whose glum Ashes visits have seen him take a wicket in Australia every 95 balls, starting up on this damp Canberra evening to find movement and create catches from the first two deliveries of the match.</p> <p>The DLS score adjustment had set Australia 130 to win, meaning that the required run rate soon exceeded 12 per over. The home team was gone, even before more rain. None of which is to say that Australia got much wrong. They go into the upcoming World Cup with an excellent best XI and an adaptable squad. It’s just that right now, England look a better side on paper and on grass.</p> <p>The same was true at last year’s tournament, when they were stacked with batting power top to tail while Australia had frailties exposed. The path to that trophy didn’t rely on finding a way to beat England, it relied on avoiding them. New Zealand offered a trans-Tasman favour by maintaining the historical role of New Zealand cricket: being a giant-killer against everybody else before falling apart against Australia.</p> <p>So the old rivalry is set at an interesting point with this year’s tournament about to start. All three of the aforementioned teams are in the same group, with Afghanistan and two qualifiers that will most likely be Sri Lanka along with Ireland or Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Don’t discount the Sri Lankans, who recorded some stirring wins across all three formats against Australia in June and July before storming on to win the Asia Cup. But as usual most eyes will be on Australia versus England, first in the group stage and then possibly again in the knockouts.</p> <p>By then, memories of warm-up matches will be distant. Everything starts fresh in a big tournament as you wait for the umpire to call play. But there are still aspects of significance that could carry over. England’s batters have shown no fear of the blue-chip pace trio of Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood. Buttler regards all bowling as there to be scored from, and his players follow his lead.</p> <p>England’s bowlers fancy themselves against Australia’s top order, and can find ways to suppress explosions from the middle. And on a longer timeline, Australian teams find ways to win the big moments even when by rights they should not.</p> <p>The dynamics between certain teams within a tournament context can be fascinating.

<aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

</aside> 
<p>The former college football and NFL star, who is endorsed by Donald Trump, was asked about his support for “a complete ban on a national level”. He said the moderator misstated his position. That contradicted statements made repeatedly on the campaign trail, including in July when Walker said it was “a problem” that no national ban existed.</p> 
<p>Walker also answered an attack from Warnock about his past claims about being a law enforcement officer by producing what he said was a police badge.</p> 
<p>Warnock said: “You can support police officers as I’ve done … while at the same time holding police officers, like all professions, accountable. One thing I have not done, I’ve never pretended to be a police officer. And I’ve never, I’ve never threatened a shootout with the police.”</p> 
<p>Saying “I have to respond to that”, Walker produced his badge.</p> 
<p>Walker has never been a trained law enforcement officer, though he has law enforcement endorsements.</p> 
<p>As Walker brandished his badge, the debate moderator said: “Mr Walker, Mr Walker – excuse me, Mr Walker. I need to let you know, Mr Walker, you are very well aware of the rules tonight. And you have a prop that is not allowed. Sir, I asked you to put that prop away.”</p> 
<p>Walker did not do so immediately.</p> 
<p>The moderator said: “Excuse me, sir. You’re very well aware of the rules, aren’t you?”</p> 
<p>Walker said: “Well, let’s talk about the truth.”</p> 
<p>Walker’s apparent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times">battle with the truth over abortion</a> has become a theme of the midterm elections. On Friday, he said his position was the same as Georgia’s state law, a so-called heartbeat bill that bans abortion at six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. That law went into effect this year after the US supreme court overturned the right to abortion.</p> 
<p>The heated exchange on abortion was one of many that highlighted stark differences between Warnock and Walker. Warnock did not directly bring up the allegation about Walker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times">paying for an abortion</a>, leaving moderators to elicit a flat denial. Walker blasted Warnock for being a Baptist pastor who supports abortion rights.</p> 
<p>“Instead of aborting those babies, why aren’t you baptizing those babies?” he said.</p> 
<p>Warnock said “God gave us a choice and I respect the right of women to make a decision”, adding that Walker “wants to arrogate more power to politicians than God has”.</p> 
<p>Warnock and his fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff won their Senate seats in a January 2021 special election, two months after Joe Biden beat Trump in Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes. It was the first time in two decades Democrats won federal elections in the state, raising questions about whether Warnock can win again as Biden’s popularity falls.</p> 
<p>In-person voting begins on Monday. The outcome will help determine control of the Senate, currently split 50-50.</p>

</aside> 
<p>Onstage, Walker claimed Warnock was a Biden puppet, saying the election was about what they “had done to you and your family” in an inflationary economy. Warnock said the election was about “who is ready to represent Georgia”.</p> 
<p>Walker blamed Warnock and Biden for inflation but offered little when asked what he would do to fix it. Walker said the first step was “getting back” to energy independence rather than depending “on our enemies”. The US had never been free from fossil fuel imports, some from countries such as Russia.</p> 
<p>Warnock highlighted Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on provisions he sponsored capping insulin and other healthcare costs, the extension of the child tax credit and infrastructure provisions he shepherded with Republicans. He offered few specifics about further steps.</p> 
<p>Warnock declined to say if Biden, nearing 80, should seek re-election in 2024. Walker deviated from Trump by saying Biden won legitimately in 2020. But he said he would support Trump if he ran in 2024. Both Walker and Warnock said they would accept the outcome of their election.</p> 
<p>Both men discussed their personal lives. Recent reporting by the Daily Beast disclosed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/herschel-walker-urged-second-abortion-new-york-times">records of an abortion receipt and personal check</a> from Walker to a woman who said he paid for her abortion. Walker’s denials have continued even after the woman identified herself as the mother of one of his four children. Walker acknowledged three children publicly for the first time only after Beast reporting.</p> 
<p>Other reports have detailed how Walker has exaggerated academic achievements, business success and philanthropic activities, as well as accusations he threatened the life of his ex-wife beyond details acknowledged in a 2008 memoir. In perhaps his most effective debate move, Warnock alluded to such stories.</p> 
<p>“We will see time and time again tonight, as we’ve always seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth,” said Warnock.</p> 
<p>Dismissing reports that a foundation tied to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he is senior pastor, had evicted tenants from real-estate holdings, Warnock said Walker was trying to “sully the name of Martin Luther King’s church”.</p> 
<p>Walker pointed to his memoir, in which he detailed a diagnosis of dissociative personality disorder. Walker said he had “been transparent” and “continue[d] to get help if I need help, but I don’t need any help. I’m doing well. I’m ready to lead today.”</p> 
<p>Walker declined three debates typical in Georgia campaigns. The Savannah debate did not include the libertarian Chase Oliver, who did not meet a polling threshold. Warnock will meet Oliver in a Sunday debate sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. Walker will be represented by an empty podium.</p><h1>‘They tried to wipe us out’: Kurds shelled as Iran seeks scapegoats for unrest</h1><h3> Publication date: 2022-10-15</h3><br><p>Picking through a pile of twisted metal, Rebaz, a Kurdish Iranian fighter, stooped to cradle a jagged chrome piece that was dug from the ruins of his base. “This was part of a Fateh missile,” he said. “It’s one of the biggest that the Iranians have in their arsenal. It’s from the day they tried to wipe us out.”</p> <p>The heap included other wreckage – of rockets and kamikaze drones that had devastated this small outpost, just east of Erbil in northern Iraq, a fortnight ago. Since then, jittery guards had looked from the ruins towards the east, from where more than two dozen ballistic missiles and another dozen kamikaze drones blazed from a blue sky a fortnight ago.</p> <p>The attack marked one of the biggest barrages of ballistic missiles anywhere in the region in at least the past decade and, across northern Iraq, few saw it coming. Except for the Iranian Kurds who have guarded this hilltop through war and insurrection, and knew what to expect from Iran, a mortal foe under mounting pressure at home.</p> <p>With the attacks, Iran sought to lay the blame <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/oct/13/iran-women-sepideh-rashno-mahsa-amini-nika-shakarami-mass-protests">for protests at home</a> on a long-term enemy, the fighters for an independent Kurdistan, a state the Kurdish ethnic group hope to one day establish on land currently in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.</p> <p>The missile barrages, three in total, sent close to 70 long-range warheads to Iranian Kurdish bases in northern Iraq, killing 14 fighters, wounding 58 and levelling bases that had fought Islamic State, the Iraqi army and Shia militias over the last eight years.</p> <p>They came as popular demonstrations were gathering momentum in Iran, pitting the country’s women and youth against one of the region’s most formidable police states. Two weeks later, and nearly six weeks into protests that continue to rattle Iran’s theocratic leaders, the mood on the streets remains febrile.</p> <p>Faced with an impetus the regime did not expect, or know how to contain, officials have attempted to divert the conflict from the streets of towns, cities and even villages, to age-old geographic flashpoints and to the more modern battleground of the information space. On both counts Iranian attempts are flailing.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="a92db316248b91883a0c1741c030912a360d18e7"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/a92db316248b91883a0c1741c030912a360d18e7/0_475_4032_2419/1000.jpg" alt="The twisted remains of Iranian missiles and drones fired at the Kurdish Iranian base in northern Iraq." width="1000" height="600" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The twisted remains of Iranian missiles and drones fired at the Kurdish Iranian base in northern Iraq.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Nechirvan Mando</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“They are not winning on the ground, and they are not deceiving anyone in Iran, or outside,” said Gen Hussein Yazdanpanah, the leader of an Iranian Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Freedom party (PAK). “Iran wants to demonstrate to the world that the protests are not relevant to what is happening inside the country and are instead driven by affairs from the outside. They are exporting this. They want the world’s attention to be taken away.”</p> <p>Yazdanpanah had come to know every inch of the hilltop that he had called a base over the past eight years. From down the road towards Kirkuk and over the hills nearby, IS had once hovered. When they were gone, Shia militias and the Iraqi army had tried to advance after an ill-fated Kurdish referendum five years ago.</p> <p>At all times, the Iranian Kurds stood their ground, committed to a broader Kurdish project as much as they were keeping Iran at bay. The general rejects Iranian claims that the protests are being driven by a Kurdish nationalist push. “It didn’t start that way, and it isn’t like that now,” he said. “We are tied to our people and the protesters. But it is not us that started these events. It is not our forces that are on the streets.</p> <p> “But they have to know that we will not stay silent in the face of this and we will defend our daughters’ blood.”</p> <p>The smell of death rose from the rubble; two fighters remained unaccounted for and only heavy equipment could shift the enormous piles of ruins caused by the ballistic missiles. What remained of the PAK’s scorched arsenal lay baking in the autumn sun. But even among the devastation, work had started on a new base a mile away. “We will prevail,” said Yazdanpanah. “But we are not satisfied with the way the international community has responded.”</p> <p>As well as watching events unfold in Iran, Iranian Kurds are well versed in the war in Ukraine, where a steady supply of powerful weapons have helped fight back a Russian invasion and could help turn the course of the war. Kurdish forces in Iraq received weapons while the war against IS was raging. But that was nearly five years ago and, once again, the Kurds feel history, and their friends, have forgotten them.</p> <p>“This territory is supervised by the international coalition and they know our role in fighting Isis. How can an airspace be monitored by them and something like this be allowed to happen? It’s like tying our hands and letting the wolf come for us. We are a people that has regularly been slaughtered for the price of supporting democracy and human rights. The only place in the region that allows room for democracy to be fertilised is here.”</p> <p>He implored the international community to consider reimposing a no-fly zone, more than 20 years after another such zone was lifted. The first was to deter Saddam Hussein from attacking the Kurdish north. “The solution is to close our skies and to stop Iran targeting us. Iran does not respect diplomatic relations, nor soft power. It only knows strength.</p> <p>“The weapons that are being given to Ukraine could also be given to us. Even a small amount. You can give the Kurds in Iran similar support. Why are you not supporting a stateless people who have fought Isis and supported your interests? Without us, they would have made it to Europe.”</p> <p>In nearby Erbil, which has so far been spared the Iranian barrage, but where officials are also considering calling for a new no-fly zone, an Iranian Kurdish refugee, Ibrahim, 29, from Urmia in the country’s north-west, said he was hopeful the uprising would continue to gain momentum.</p> <p>“There was a time when protests in Iran happened every 10 years or so, but that gap has been closing. It’s now every two years, and that shows that the regime is losing its hold.</p> <p>“They can’t think they can continue to run a repressive regime like this in an information age. The worst thing for them was the Covid lockdown. People and students had all that time to stay at home and look at the internet. They saw how life could be and they wanted a taste of it.</p> <p>“It is not an armed uprising for now. And I hope it doesn’t become one. But if it does, the problem will be, where would those weapons come from. This needs to be taken very seriously.”</p> <p>An Iranian Kurdish woman, Arina, 28, from Sanandaj, said: “It’s never been like this, all minorities and ethnicities fighting together for basic human rights. I have many friends in the streets whom I talk to daily.</p> <p>“Every time I talk to my friends I say they’re very motivated. It’s very different from previous protests. In some areas the government has already lost control.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Nechirvan Mando</em></p><h1>TV tonight: Wossy is back with Daisy May Cooper and Lewis Capaldi </h1><h3> Publication date: 2022-10-15</h3><br><h2>The Jonathan Ross Show</h2> <h2>10pm, ITV</h2> <p>After bringing football home this summer, England player Chloe Kelly is one of the first guests to have a chinwag with Wossy in his latest series.

It’s going to be a bumpy night.” Joseph Mankiewicz’s delicious drama of backstabbing in the theatre world could equally apply to the Hollywood that produced it, with an ageing actress sidelined by a younger one. Bette Davis is magisterial as grande dame of Broadway Margo Channing, who takes young fan Eve (Anne Baxter) under her wing only to find she’s a cuckoo in the nest. The gender politics may not stand up to today’s expectations, but there’s a wealth of lively characters to enjoy. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Rugby Union Women’s World Cup: France v England, 7.30am, ITV</strong> The second Pool C match, as Sarah Hunter (pictured above) captains England at Northland Events Centre in Whangarei, New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Leicester v Crystal Palace, 11.30am, BT Sport 1</strong> At King Power Stadium.

They sold this month at a New Mexico auction for $76,000, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeans-vintage-levis-1880s-auction-buyer-11665444076">Wall Street Journal</a> reported – among the highest prices jeans have ever fetched. The buyers, who each sell vintage clothing, were able to identify the jeans’ age thanks to a number of clues: a missing logo stamp, suspender buttons and a single pocket on the seat, among other indicators.</p> <p>Another mark of the jeans’ age: a label inside says they are “the only kind made by white labor”.</p> <p>That message appeared after Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, amid widespread anti-Chinese racism, particularly as the <a href="https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/chineseinca/antichinese.html">economy struggled in the 1870s</a>. Such bigotry was particularly prevalent in the west. San Francisco – home to Levi’s, founded in 1853 – drew a large number of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, and, as Michael Luo wrote in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-forgotten-history-of-the-purging-of-chinese-from-america">New Yorker</a> last year, “white workers … began to see the Chinese as competition – first for gold and, later, for scarce jobs.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/experience-i-mine-for-denim">Experience: I mine for 100-year-old jeans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exclusion law, which established a 10-year ban on Chinese laborers seeking to immigrate to the US, became the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act">first major restriction on immigration</a> in the US. It <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-Exclusion-Act">was not repealed until 1943</a>.</p> <p>In the 1880s, “​​there was significant social pressure not to hire Chinese workers and [Levi Strauss and Co] adopted an anti-Chinese labor policy,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Levi’s also used advertisements and printing on our products to declare that our products were ‘made by white labor’, thinking it would improve sales and align with the views of consumers at the time.”</p> <p>In the 1890s, the company said, “we reversed our policy and company leaders began speaking out against the nation’s racist policy.”</p> <p>Beyond the design elements, the jeans’ age is also clear from the wax spattered across them. Levi’s were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/experience-i-mine-for-denim">worn by silver miners</a> in the west, as Harris wrote in the Guardian in 2015, and miners lit their way with candles, the Journal notes.</p> <p>All this explains why Harris found them in a western mineshaft. “When a miner got a new pair of work pants, he’d cut up the old ones and use them for lagging around pipes, so there were a lot of antique jeans buried out here,” he wrote in the 2015 piece.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="026c103abb087305859da7365042718247bf7370"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/026c103abb087305859da7365042718247bf7370/0_0_1490_1687/883.jpg" alt="A pair of Levi’s jeans from the 1880s.

The material can sell for hefty sums, but “I’m not focused on the money,” Harris wrote. “I’ve become a sort of archivist and historian.”</p> <p>Despite their historical significance, you might not know that the jeans were nearly 150 years old if you encountered them in a thrift shop. They’re still fully wearable, according to Zip Stevenson, who paid 10% of the cost; the other 90% was covered by Kyle Haupert, a 23-year-old from San Diego, the Journal reported. The wearability “is a big part of why we believe they are so extremely valuable,” even if “they could use a little mending in a couple of spots”, Stevenson wrote to the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>Stevenson, who runs Denim Doctors, a Los Angeles business that repairs well-loved clothing, became interested in the material when he worked at a shop selling vintage Levi’s and realized they were selling for more than the brand-new pairs at a store a few doors down. He thinks the 1880s pair is worth “no less than $150,000 and potentially quite a bit more”, he says. “We believe that there’s no reason they would not be worth even up to $1m in the context of other collectible things like rare watches, art by famous artists, rare comic books and sports memorabilia.”</p> <p>And who might have the money to make such an investment? “I could see a wealthy eccentric person buying them and then wearing them from time to time like people that wear million-dollar Paul Newman Rolex watches,” Stevenson said.</p> <p>But the ideal buyer would be “someone that will then offer them on permanent loan to a highly visited museum like a Smithsonian or the Metropolitan Museum in New York so that people could see them in perpetuity” as a part of American history, Stevenson added. “We are OK to be patient to find the right home for them.”</p>
